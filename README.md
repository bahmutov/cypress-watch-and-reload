> Reloads Cypress when one of the watched files changes

## Video

Watch this plugin in action in the short video [Re-run Cypress Tests When Application Files Change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIyTBtUmmdE) and [Nodemon And cypress-watch-and-reload Utilities](https://youtu.be/fy4qYGK690Q)

## Install

```shell
npm install -D cypress-watch-and-reload
# or using Yarn
yarn add -D cypress-watch-and-reload
```

### Cypress v10+

Load this plugin from your [cypress.config.js](./cypress.config.js) file

```js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    env: {
      // list the files and file patterns to watch
      'cypress-watch-and-reload': {
        watch: ['page/*', 'circle.yml'],
      },
    },
    // We've imported your old cypress plugins here.
    // You may want to clean this up later by importing these.
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-watch-and-reload
      return require('cypress-watch-and-reload/plugins')(on, config)
    },
  },
})
```

Add to your `cypress/support/e2e.js` file

```js
require('cypress-watch-and-reload/support')
```

Note: this plugin will work if you pass both `on` and `config` arguments, or just the `config` argument.

```js
// pass both arguments
require('cypress-watch-and-reload/plugins')(on, config)
// or pass just the config object
require('cypress-watch-and-reload/plugins')(config)
```

**Important:** make sure to return the plugin registration or the `config` object

```js
// return the registration
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
  return require('cypress-watch-and-reload/plugins')(on, config)
}
// or return the config object
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
  require('cypress-watch-and-reload/plugins')(on, config)
  return config
}
```

### Cypress v9

Add to your `cypress/plugins/index.js` file

```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-watch-and-reload
  require('cypress-watch-and-reload/plugins')(config)
  // IMPORTANT: return the config object
  // because the plugin might have changed it
  return config
}
```

Add to your `cypress/support/index.js` file

```js
require('cypress-watch-and-reload/support')
```

In your `cypress.json` set wildcard with files to watch. For example

```json
{
  "cypress-watch-and-reload": {
    "watch": "page/*"
  }
}
```

Every time you change one of the files matching the wildcard, Cypress will reload itself, rerunning the tests.

You can use a list of files / wildcard patterns to watch:

```json
{
  "cypress-watch-and-reload": {
    "watch": ["page/*", "src/*.js"]
  }
}
```

This package uses [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) under the hood, see [plugins.js](plugins.js). The client-side setup is disabled if you are running Cypress in non-interactive mode using `cypress run` command.

## UI

There is a button to disable watching the files, which is useful sometimes to modify lots of files before running the tests.

## Example

See the projects [cypress-watch-and-reload-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-watch-and-reload-example) and [chat.io](https://github.com/bahmutov/chat.io)

## Details

This plugin opens a WebSocket connection from Cypress to its Node backend. The backend is watching the specified files. Whenever you change a file, Cypress will notice and will reload itself, rerunning tests.

## Development

To see the plugin in action, open Cypress in this repository

```shell
npm run cy:open
```

Then edit and save any file in the "page" folder and see the tests re-run automatically.
